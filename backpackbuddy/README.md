## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (for Docker setup)
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher, for manual setup)
*   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.10 or higher, for manual setup)
*   API Keys for Groq, Serper, and OpenTripMap

### 1. Installation

First, clone the repository and set up your environment variables.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/backpackbuddy.git
    cd backpackbuddy
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    This is required for both Docker and manual setup. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Open the `.env` file and add your API keys.

### 2. Running the Application

You can run BackpackBuddy using either Docker (recommended for a production-like experience) or manually for development.

#### Option A: Running with Docker

This is the easiest way to get started. It builds the production versions of the frontend and backend and runs them in isolated containers.

1.  **Build and run the containers:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
2.  **Access the application:**
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

#### Option B: Manual Setup (for Development)

This method is ideal for development, as it provides hot-reloading for both the frontend and backend. You will need two separate terminal windows.

**Terminal 1: Run the Backend**
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
The backend will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

**Terminal 2: Run the Frontend**
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Run the Vite development server
npm run dev
```
The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
